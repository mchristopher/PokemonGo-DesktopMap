Getting Started
---------------

Running the application is easy! You can download the latest version from the [Release page](https://github.com/mchristopher/PokemonGo-DesktopMap/releases).

Once you have downloaded the appropriate ZIP file for your platform, extract it and run "Pokemon GO Live Map" and follow the instructions.

Development Environment
-----------------------

If you are pulling from git, you must first instruct git to fetch the included submodules. Run this after cloning:

    git submodule update --init --recursive

Development is currently done on OS X and tested on Windows 10. To get started, you'll need to install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/), Python 2.7, pip, and virtualenv. With Homebrew, I use:

    brew install python node
    pip install virtualenv
    virtualenv .
    source bin/activate
    npm install

To run the project, run:

    npm start
